# Introduction to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

A fundamental idea in finance is that investors need financial incentives to take on risk. Thus, the expected return R on a risky investment, e.g., a stock, should exceed the risk-free return Rf, or the excess return (R - Rf) should be positive. Typically, for risk-free rate we use short-term government bonds, like the US 3-month treasury bills https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIRX?p=^IRX
 

The Capital Asset Market Pricing Model (CAPM) states that the return on a particular risky asset is related to returns of the 'market' as follows: 

   $Return(asset) = \alpha + \beta*Return(market)+error$
   
   
The $\alpha$ is the "excess return" of a stock. According to the CAPM, this "excess return" is the reward for taking on the "specific risk" of the stock. As this risk can be eliminated through holding a diversified portfolio, CAPM says the excess return should be close to zero.

The $\beta$ is a measure of the "market risk" of a stock. It is an indication of how sensitive the stock is to movements in the market as a whole; for a 1% market movement, $\beta=1$ implies the stock tends to move 1%, $\beta<1$ means the stock tends to move by less than 1%,  whereas $\beta>1$ means the stock tends to move more than 1%, or it 'exaggerates' market movements.

We will run linear regressions to estimate the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of a couple of stocks, as well as their specific risk. We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical prices off the internet and will also see some R code that allows us to calculate a rolling beta. We will explore the relationship between returns (%) of the market (SPY, an ETF that tracks the S&P500) and for a number of stocks, namely Apple (ticker symbol: AAPL),  JPMorgan (JPM), Disney (DIS), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF). 



## Loading the data

The `tidyquant` package comes with a number of functions, utilities that allow us to download financial data off the web, as well as ways of handling all this data. 

We begin by loading the data set into the R workspace. We create a collection of stocks with their ticker symbols and then use the _piping_ operator _%>%_ to use tidyquant's `tq_get` to donwload historical data from Jan 1, 2011 to Dec 31, 2017 using Yahoo finance and, again, to group data by their ticker symbol.

```{r load-data, cache=TRUE}
myStocks <- c("AAPL","JPM","DIS","DPZ","ANF","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2017-08-01",
         to   = "2020-09-30") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

str(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

For each ticker symbol, the data frame contains its `symbol`, the `date`, the prices for `open`,`high`, `low` and `close`, and the `volume`, or how many stocks were traded on that day. More importantly, the data frame contains the `adjusted` closing price, which adjusts for any stock splits and/or dividends paid and this is what we will be using for our analyses.

Towards the end, you a see a line `- attr(*, "group_sizes")= int  1761 1761 1761 1761 1761 1761 1761 1761`.
Since we grouped our data by its ticker symbol, you can see that over the course of 7 years (2011-2017) we have 1761 trading days, or roughly 250 trading days per year. 

Financial performance and CAPM analysis depend on __returns__ and not on __adjusted closing prices__. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns. 

```{r calculate_returns,include=FALSE}

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly.returns") 

#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily.returns")  
```


For yearly and monthly data, we assume discrete changes, so we the formula used to calculate the return for month __(t+1)__ is 

$Return(t+1)= \frac{Adj.Close(t+1)}{Adj.Close (t)}-1$

For daily data we use log returns,  or $Return(t+1)= LN\frac{Adj.Close(t+1)}{Adj.Close (t)}$

The reason we use log returns are:

a.	Compound interest interpretation; namely, that the log return can be interpreted as the continuously (rather than discretely) compounded rate of return

b.	Log returns are assumed to follow a normal distribution

c.	Log return over n periods is the sum of n log returns


We may want to see what our investments would have grown to, of we had invested $1000 in each of the assets  on Aug 1, 2017. 

```{r wealth_index, echo=FALSE}
#calculate 'daily'wealth' returns, or what a 100 investment will grow to 
cumulative_wealth <- myStocks_returns_daily %>%
  mutate(wealth.index = 1000 * cumprod(1 + daily.returns))


ggplot(cumulative_wealth, aes(x=date, y = wealth.index))+
  geom_line(aes(colour=symbol))+
  labs(x="Year", 
       y="Value of investment", 
       title = "Growth of a $1000 investment over time") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  theme_minimal()+
  NULL
```

## Scatterplots of individual stocks returns versus S&P500 Index returns.

Besides these exploratory graphs of returns and price evolution, we also need to create scatterplots among the returns of different stocks. `ggpairs` crates a scatterplot matrix that shows the distribution of returns for each stock, and a matrix of scatter plots and correlations. This may take a while to run, but look at the last row, the last column and along the diagonal.


```{r correlationMatrix, echo=FALSE}
#calculate daily returns
monthly_capm_returns <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>%
            spread(key = symbol, value = monthly.returns)  #just keep the period returns grouped by symbol


ggpairs(monthly_capm_returns[-1]) #exclude "Date", the first column, from the correlation matrix

```

The next step is to fit a liner regression model to calculate the $\beta$ of AAPL. After fitting the model, we produce a summary table for the regression model, a 95% confidence interval for the coefficients, and an ANOVA table that shows the split of variability (`Sum Sq`) of AAPL returns and what portion ix explained by the market (`SPY`) versus the unexplained residuals.

Besides fitting the model, we should also have a look at the residuals. Do they seem to follow a Normal Distribution? Is there a pattern in the residuals, or do they appear to be 'random'? Is the variance of the residuals constant or does it seem to increase with increasing values of X?


First, we plot the residuals vs. the fitted (or predicted) values. This is a standard regression diagnostic plot to check whether there is no pattern in the residuals, as well as to test for heteroscedasticity, or whether the residuals appear to have unequal, non-constant variance.

The second thing we must check is whether the residuals follow a Normal distribution. A normal scores, or a QQ plot,  allows us to check for skewness, kurtosis and outliers. (Note that the heteroscedasticity may show as apparent non-normality.)

```{r AAPL_CAPM, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(monthly_capm_returns, aes(x=SPY, y = AAPL))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)

aapl_capm <- lm(AAPL ~ SPY, data = monthly_capm_returns)
mosaic::msummary(aapl_capm)

aapl_capm %>% broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE)
aapl_capm %>% broom::glance()

autoplot(aapl_capm)
